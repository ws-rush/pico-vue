# Server Integration

pocket-vue is designed from the ground up for progressive enhancement. It's most powerful when used alongside server-side frameworks like Django, Laravel, Rails, or ASP.NET.

Instead of building a Single Page Application (SPA), you can keep your routing, authentication, and primary data fetching on the server and use pocket-vue to "sprinkle" interactivity where it's needed.

## Framework Guides

We have dedicated guides for the most popular server-side frameworks:

- [**Django**](/guides/django)
- [**Rails**](/guides/rails)
- [**Laravel**](/guides/laravel)
- [**ASP.NET Core**](/guides/aspnet)

## Core Integration Patterns

### 1. Initial State Injection
The most common pattern is injecting initial state directly into `v-scope` during the server-side render.

```html
<div v-scope="{ 
    user: {{ user_json|safe }},
    settings: {{ settings_json|safe }}
}">
    <h1>Hello, {{ user.name }}</h1>
</div>
```

### 2. Handling CSRF Tokens
Any AJAX requests made from pocket-vue must include a CSRF token.

**Option 1: Read from Meta Tag (Recommended)**
```javascript
const getToken = () => document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').content

function submit() {
    fetch('/api/save', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'X-CSRF-TOKEN': getToken(),
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(this.formData)
    })
}
```

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
Design your features to work without JavaScript first, then enhance them with pocket-vue.

```html
<!-- Fully functional without JS -->
<form action="/search" method="GET" v-scope @submit.prevent="ajaxSearch">
    <input name="q" type="search" v-model="query">
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>

<script>
    function ajaxSearch() {
        // If JS is enabled, this runs instead of the standard form submission
        fetch('/api/search?q=' + this.query)
            .then(res => res.json())
            .then(results => this.results = results)
    }
</script>
```

---

### 4. Avoiding Delimiter Conflicts
If your server-side template engine also uses `{{ }}`, you can change pocket-vue's delimiters.

```javascript
createApp({
  $delimiters: ['[[', ']]']
}).mount()
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Simple**: Use pocket-vue for interactive "islands", not for the entire page structure unless necessary.
- **Server-Side Validation**: Always perform validation on the server, even if you have real-time validation on the client.
- **SEO First**: Render critical content on the server so it's accessible to search engines and users with JavaScript disabled.
- **Minimal State**: Only pass the data needed for interactivity to the client to keep page size small.
