## Why pocket-vue?

pocket-vue is a fork of petite-vue, providing a modern, maintained solution for developers who want the power of Vue's reactivity without the overhead of a full Single Page Application (SPA).

```html
<!-- No build step required! -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/pocket-vue" defer init></script>

<div v-scope="{ count: 0 }">
  {{ count }}
  <button @click="count++">Increment</button>
</div>
```
