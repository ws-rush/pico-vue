# pocket-vue

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/ws-rush/pocket-vue)

`pocket-vue` is a fork of `petite-vue`, which is an alternative distribution of [Vue](https://vuejs.org) optimized for [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement). It provides the same template syntax and reactivity mental model as standard Vue. However, it is specifically optimized for "sprinkling" a small amount of interactions on an existing HTML page rendered by a server framework.
